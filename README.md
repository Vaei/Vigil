## Features

### Modular Data-Driven Setup

Very easy to customize, modify, and extend behaviours without writing any C++ or modifying the base plugin. Vigil is built on top of the Targeting System plugin.

### Quick Setup

Vigil can be setup in mere minutes with usable results drawn to screen.

### Multiple Focus Channels

Not a single-use focusing system, add as many focus channels as you need. Vigil will tell you what ally, and enemy, and interactable we're focused on separately.

### Robust Results

Vigil provides the results via a callback that you can assign to from anywhere. These are already sorted for you, so the current focus is the first index, but you have access to all options as well as their scoring for visual purposes if you need it.

### Optional Net Prediction

Run the scan ability as `Local Only` or set to `Local Predicted` if you need predicted focus results!

### Logging and Debugging

Vigil includes verbose logging that will allow you to see every stage of the focusing system to make diagnosing issues easy. There are debugging tools to visualize what is happening.
